Your report is neat and organized (+5). Your CO2 trend calculation without buffer effect seems to be lower than Fig. 2 in the article (-3), please check your code again. Besides, your x-axis (year) datatype is confused, I think it should not be in `float` type, in `int` would be better. Keep going!
